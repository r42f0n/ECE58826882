ECE5882/6882 
Part 1:4 pts. 

RS = 50Ω and ZL   =   72+j94Ω.
In the above circuit, a matching network (MN) is used to   match   the   load   impedance   ZL   with the source resistor RS. The input signal   frequency is   500   MHz.
[a] 1 pts. Design a Matching   (MN) Circuit using   Smith   Chart.
[b] 1 pts. Draw complete circuit schematic, including   the   load.
[c] 1 pts. Simulate the complete circuit and plot the ratio   of   the voltage   at   the   output to the input voltage from 0 to   1.5 GHz   (vout/vin   vs f ).   Report bandwidth-BW and Quality factor.
[d] 1 pts Find the power efficiency delivered to the load with and without   the matching network. You can sue simulation   for this. 
Part 2: 6 pts. 

Let IC1= 2-10 mA, VT = 26 mV, Rs   =50 ohm. Vb1     Vb2   are the bias voltages.
[a] 1 pts. Find an equation for H(w)= vout(w)/vin(w). Use the high   frequency   model   for   the transistors. Note Q1 and Q2 are the   same transistors.
[b] 1 pts. Present an expression for the low-f代 写ECE5882/6882 AssignmentSPSS
代做程序编程语言requency voltage   gain, Av   = vout/vin.
[c] 2 pts. Design and simulate this   amplifier such   that   the   gain   will be   equal   or   more than   10 dB, at   100MHz or higher (fopt ≥100 MHz). Clearly   show the biasing   circuits used to obtain Vb1 and Vb2   . 
[d] 1 pts. Use AC analysis, plot the gain (vout/vin).   Discuss low-frequency   and high   frequency gains by considering several points at low frequencies   as   well   high frequencies for comparison. Make reasonable arguments. 
[e] 1 pts. Analyse the linearity of   the amplifier by plotting   1dB compression point. 
[f] Bonus: 1 pts. If   you plot and   calculate   IIP3 power   (PIIP3). 
Note: An ideal transistor is not accepted.
Submission: 
Submit your report via the link provided on the Moodle before 4:30 pm, September 3.
•         You are required to submit your circuit (only   schematic file,   LTspice   or   ADS   is   fine).
•         This   assignment   should   be   done   individually.
